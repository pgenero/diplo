Hi, I’m Pablo Genero, from San Francisco, Córdoba, Argetina. 
I have a degree in Accounting, and I am currently studying a diploma in Business Data Analytics, intended for professionals in economics and business. 
I also work as an administrative analyst at ARCOR SAIC, an argentine multinational company in the mass consumption sector.
I really enjoy working on analysis tasks, manipulating different types of data, being able to generate visualizations.
I like to learn and face challenges that require thinking creative solutions.

In this repository, I have uploaded some of the work and practices that I am developing as I progress in my data studies.

***📌 Proyección Resultado - R:*** *It is a work developed as a practice using the R language to perform a statistical analysis and projection on the accounting results of a wine cellar*

***📌 Tablero Inventarios - Power BI:*** *This work consists of building a dashboard using Adventure Works data, with the purpose of trying to provide a solution that helps in the management of business inventories. The dashboard contains multiple visualizations and metrics created with DAX. In addition, the ETL process is applied on the data tables using the Power Query editor.*

***📌 DataFrame:*** *It's a short practice developed with Python and Pandas, where I basically work with a dataframe, beginning with the import of the data form a GitHub repository, and appling several functions to take some conclussions about the dataset quality.*

🛠 Some tools that I use:
+ Excel
+ R
+ Power BI
+ Mycrostrategy
+ MySQL
+ Pentaho

👨🏼‍🎓 I’m currently learning Python
